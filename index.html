  <!-- Buildtall Cities is an attempt to recreate,
    by procedural means, the paintings by Charles Bunnell,
    pictured at  buildtall.com/IMG_20140922_003533.jpg

    I've since moved beyond a static recreation of the paintings,
    and have implemented what I think of as a time-lapse view 
    of the evolution of one of Bunnell's cities over time.
